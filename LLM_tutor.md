## Introduction to Tensors

Tensors are a fundamental data structure in machine learning and deep learning, often used to store data in multi-dimensional shape. They can be thought of as an extension of matrices to higher dimensions. Tensors are essential for building neural networks, especially for handling inputs for models in frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

### Types of Tensors
1. **Scalar Tensors**: A single number (0D tensor).
2. **Vector Tensors**: An array of numbers (1D tensor).
3. **Matrix Tensors**: A 2D array of numbers (2D tensor).
4. **n-D Tensors**: Multi-dimensional arrays (3D tensor and above).

### Operations on Tensors
Tensors allow various operations such as addition, multiplication, and reshaping. These operations are optimized in libraries like NumPy for efficient computation.

### Applications of Tensors
- **Computer Vision**: Manipulating images and videos.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Representing text data for models.
- **Physics Simulations**: Modeling physical systems in multiple dimensions.
